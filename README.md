### Project Introduction — Scraping Zillow Listings for Analysis

These projects explore multiple strategies for harvesting listing data from **Zillow** and loading it into a pandas DataFrame for downstream analysis. We’ll start with a lightweight pipeline that pairs `requests` with **BeautifulSoup** to parse the static HTML, then graduate to a more sophisticated workflow that employs **Selenium** to handle infinite scroll and navigate pagination. By comparing these “quick-and-simple” and “fully dynamic” approaches, you’ll see how to choose the right level of complexity for your data-collection needs—balancing robustness, speed, and code maintainability.
